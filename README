reappy (Twitter Search Application framework)

What is reappy?

reappy is a Twitter Search Application Framework that lets you write twitter search apps (like @having).

Hello World!

Here is a little hello world program that prints "Hey <username>" everytime someone tweets with the word "Hi" in it.

import reappy

def print_hi(tweet):
    print "%s just said hi!", % tweet.user.user_name

app = reappy.application("hi",
			[(".*", print_hi)]
			)

app.loop()


That's all!
